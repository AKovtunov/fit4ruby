Fit4Ruby
========

Fit4Ruby is a Ruby libary to read and write FIT files. It is currently
only tested with FIT files generated by the Garmin Forerunner 620.

This libary is still work in progress and probably not yet ready to be
used in your application. However, you are welcome to try it and send
me comments and patches.
